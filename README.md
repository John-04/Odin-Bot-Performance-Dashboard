## Key Metrics

The dashboard tracks several critical performance indicators:

- **Profitability Rate:** 51% of wallets are profitable
- **Top Token Traded:** WSOL-C1ON
- **Total Profits (Last 30 Days):** $162,022,054,685
- **Active Wallets:** 10,562,422
- **Top Wallet Win Rate:** 100%
- **Top Wallet ROI:** 100%

## Dashboard Sections

### Part 1: Overall Performance

Analyzes OdinBot's performance across 26.9 million active wallets, highlighting:

- Only 16 wallets are managing to capture real value in a highly competitive space
- 30-day ecosystem generation of $245.5 billion in profits
- Top-performing wallet achieved a flawless 100% win rate and 100% ROI
- Trading activity timeline showing volume trends over time

### Part 2: Profit Distribution Analysis

Examines the concentration of profitability:

- **Profit Concentration:** Top 50 wallets capture only 9.2% of total profits, while the remaining wallets collectively account for 90.8%
- **Win Rate vs Profitability:** Correlation analysis showing that most high-worth wallets maintain consistently strong win rates
- **ROI Analysis:** Several wallets demonstrate near-perfect win rates with ROI percentages approaching 100%
- **Leaderboard:** Top profitable wallets generated $4.49 billion across over 5.1 million trades, with an average trade size of ~$2,000

The analysis reveals that, unlike many markets where elite players dominate profitability, in this case it's far more distributed across the broader ecosystem. This suggests that profitability is highly concentrated among a small elite group, rather than a few bots or wallets extracting the majority of value.

### Part 3: Token Preferences & Capital Concentration

Reveals trading patterns and asset preferences:

- **Token Preferences:** The vast majority of volume is overwhelmingly focused on just two tokens: a new asset, test, and the stablecoin, USDC
- **WSOL Dominance:** Over 16 billion in USDC, following closely behind at approximately 10.77 billion
- **Capital Concentration:** Despite the broad array of tokens available, profitable wallets show a clear preference for a limited set of high-volume assets

This stark difference in volume highlights a clear preference, showing that even with a diverse set of tokens, the capital of profitable wallets is highly concentrated in what is likely a key stablecoin and a standard new asset.
